# Smart-Pricing-for-Homestays-A-Comprehensive-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction-Approach
Predicting the home prices based on the requirements using ML techniques

This project aims to build a robust predictive model to estimate the `log price` of homestay listings through comprehensive data analysis and feature engineering. Key tasks include cleaning the dataset, deriving features like `Host Tenure` and `Amenities Count`, conducting exploratory and geospatial analysis, and applying sentiment analysis to descriptions. The project involves developing and optimizing models such as RandomForest and GradientBoosting, Linear Regression, validating their performance, and assessing feature importance to ensure accurate and insightful price predictions.
