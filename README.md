# Smart-Pricing-for-Homestays-A-Comprehensive-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction-Approach
Predicting the home prices based on the requirements using ML techniques

This project aims to build a robust predictive model to estimate the `log price` of homestay listings through comprehensive data analysis and feature engineering. Key tasks include cleaning the dataset, deriving features like `Host Tenure` and `Amenities Count`, conducting exploratory and geospatial analysis, and applying sentiment analysis to descriptions. The project involves developing and optimizing models such as RandomForest and GradientBoosting, Linear Regression, validating their performance, and assessing feature importance to ensure accurate and insightful price predictions.

### Homestays Price Prediction and Data Analysis

**Goal:** Develop a robust predictive model to estimate the `log price` of homestay listings using a detailed analysis of their features, amenities, and host data.

**Step-by-Step Tasks and Summaries:**

1. **Data Sanitization and Preparation:**
   - Ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis and modeling. Address missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies in data formats.

2. **Feature Enhancement:**
   - **Host Tenure:** Compute the number of years from `host since` to the current date to gauge host experience.
   - **Amenities Count:** Tally the items listed in the `amenities` array to measure property offerings.
   - **Days Since Last Review:** Calculate the days between `last review` and today to evaluate listing activity and relevance.

3. **In-Depth Data Analysis:**
   - Examine pricing (`log price`) correlations with categorical variables (e.g., `room type`, `property type`) and numerical variables (e.g., `accommodates`, `number of reviews`).
   - Utilize statistical tools and visualizations (correlation matrices, histograms, scatter plots) to investigate relationships between variables.

4. **Spatial Analysis:**
   - Explore geographical data to discern regional pricing patterns.
   - Map listings using `latitude` and `longitude` to visually assess price distribution.
   - Analyze if neighborhood or proximity to city centers affects pricing.

5. **Sentiment Evaluation on Descriptions:**
   - Employ natural language processing to analyze `description` texts and extract sentiment scores.
   - Determine if the tone of descriptions impacts listing prices and incorporate these insights into the predictive model.

6. **Amenities Examination:**
   - Thoroughly analyze the `amenities` listed in the properties.
   - Identify which amenities are correlated with higher or lower prices using statistical tests.

7. **Categorical Data Transformation:**
   - Transform categorical data into a machine learning-compatible format.
   - Apply one-hot encoding to variables like `room type`, `city`, and `property type` to ensure the model can interpret these as distinct features.

8. **Model Creation and Training:**
   - Develop and train predictive models to estimate `log price`.
   - Start with a basic linear regression for baseline performance, then explore advanced models such as RandomForest and GradientBoosting to capture complex relationships.

9. **Model Refinement and Validation:**
   - Optimize the models for best performance using techniques like grid search for hyperparameter tuning.
   - Validate models using k-fold cross-validation to ensure generalizability to unseen data.

10. **Feature Impact and Model Insights:**
    - Analyze trained models to determine which features most significantly influence `log price`.
    - Use feature importance scores for tree-based models and SHAP values for detailed feature contributions.

11. **Predictive Accuracy Evaluation:**
    - Evaluate the final model's performance on a reserved test set.
    - Use metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared to measure accuracy and fit.
    - Provide a detailed residual analysis to identify any patterns suggesting model biases or inaccuracies.
